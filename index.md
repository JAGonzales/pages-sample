Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff!
Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Bender, we're trying our best. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! But existing is basically all I do!

Belligerent and numerous. Oh right. I forgot about the battle. You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!

It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too.
I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. But existing is basically all I do! Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.

You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?
Why did you bring us here?
Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts!
It's toe-tappingly tragic!
Who am I making this out to? Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'?

Hey, whatcha watching?
Yes! In your face, Gandhi!
File not found.
All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?

Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.

I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. That's not soon enough! Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!

I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!

Moving along… Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? You mean while I'm sleeping in it?

Really?! Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.

I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.

Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!

Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.

The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.
